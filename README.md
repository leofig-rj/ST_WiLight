# Introduction

This projecto intents to connect WiLights devices (www.wilight.com.br) to SmartTings.
WiLights are WIFI enabled devices that communicate with the SmartThings hub over the local LAN.

This project uses SmartThings Composite Device Handler (DH). This functionality allows one Parent DH to create many Child Devices (using Child DHs). This allows more than one of each SmartThings capability per WiLight real device.
The WiLight Parent DH has been written to automagically create Child Devices that exist in WiLight real device.
